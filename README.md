## Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
This project applies machine learning techniques to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine. The dataset contains anonymized transaction details with numerical features. The focus is on model comparison, evaluation, and interpretability, rather than on deploying a production system.
## Objective
Detect potential fraudulent transactions using supervised machine learning models, and compare their performance to select the most effective one.

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Checked for missing values and anomalies
   * Standardized features to improve model performance

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Distribution of features
   * Class imbalance identification
   * Correlation analysis

3. **Model Training**

   * Logistic Regression
   * Random Forest
   * XGBoost
   * LightGBM
   * Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna for selected models

4. **Evaluation**

   * Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
   * Confusion matrix for classification breakdown
